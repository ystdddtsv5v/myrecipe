La Pizza
(from https://en.wikipedia.org)

Pizza is a traditional Italian dish consisting of a yeasted flatbread typically
topped with tomato sauce and cheese and baked in an oven. It can also be topped
with additional vegetables, meats, and condiments, and can be made without
cheese. The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century, in a Latin
manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with
Campania. Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants
have since become popular and common in many areas of the world. In 2009,
upon Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza was registered with the European Union
as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed dish. The Associazione Verace Pizza
Napoletana (True Neapolitan Pizza Association), a non-profit organization founded
in 1984 with headquarters in Naples, aims to "promote and protect the true
Neapolitan pizza".
