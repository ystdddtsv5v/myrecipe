Le Pain au chocolat (not Chocolatine!)

Pain au chocolat, literally chocolate bread; also known as chocolatine in the
south-west part of France and in Canada or couque au chocolat in Belgium), is a
type of viennoiserie sweet roll consisting of a cuboid-shaped piece of
yeast-leavened laminated dough, similar in texture to a puff pastry, with one or
two pieces of dark chocolate in the centre. Pain au chocolat is made of the same
layered doughs as a croissant. Often sold still hot or warm from the oven, they
are commonly sold alongside croissants in French bakeries and supermarkets.

Legend has it that Marie-Antoinette introduced the croissant to France, but
croissants and pains au chocolat are a relatively modern invention.
The type of pastry, called "viennoiserie" in French, was introduced in the early
19th century, when August Zang, an Austrian officer, and Ernest Schwarzer, an
Austrian aristocrat, founded a Viennese bakery in Paris located at 92 rue
Richelieu. Originally, croissants and pains aux chocolat were made from a
brioche base but later evolved to incorporate a buttery flaky dough
(pâte feuilletée).
