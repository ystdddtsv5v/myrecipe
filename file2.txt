La Baguette
(from https://en.wikipedia.org)

A baguette is a long, thin loaf of French bread that is commonly made from basic
lean dough (the dough, though not the shape, is defined by French law). It is
distinguishable by its length and crisp crust.
A baguette has a diameter of about 5 or 6 centimetres (2 or 2â…“ in) and a usual
length of about 65 centimetres (26 in), although a baguette can be up to a metre
(39 in) long. The word "baguette" was not used to refer to a type of bread until
1920, but what is now known as a baguette may have existed well before that
date. The word simply means "wand", "baton" or "stick", as in baguette magique
(magic wand), baguettes chinoises (chopsticks), or baguette de direction
(conductor's baton).

An unsourced article in The Economist states that in October 1920 a law
prevented bakers from working before 4 a.m., making it impossible to make
traditional round loaves in time for customers' breakfasts. Switching from the
round loaf to the previously-less-common slender shape of the baguette, the
article claims, solved the problem, because it could be prepared and baked much
more quickly.
The law in question appears to be one from March 1919, though some say it took
effect in October 1920: It is forbidden to employ workers at bread and pastry
making between ten in the evening and four in the morning.
The rest of the account remains to be verified, but the use of the word for a
long thin bread does appear to be a twentieth century innovation.
